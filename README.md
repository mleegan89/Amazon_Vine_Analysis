# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. To determine the success of this program we measured the percent of 5 star reviews produced by both paid and unpaid reviewers. For this analysis we were looking at data provided by Amazon regarding watches. This data can be found at https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Watches_v1_00.tsv.gz

## Summary

Based on the analysis for this particular item, we can determine that a higher percentage of non-Vine reviewers leave 5 star reviews. This is somewhat interesting because it would be easy to assume that paid reviewers would be more likely to leave higher ratings. This may just be because of the certain item that we chose to analyze. 

In order to better determine the success, or lack thereof, for paid reviews we would also need to look at the average number of stars given by both categories of reviewers. A quick mean or median analysis of the # of stars would be able to demonstrate this further analysis.
